A simple Hangman game i was given to make as a assignment in my 2nd semester and the University.
 
 ♦️Here is how it works:
 1) You get a random country from a list of selected countries that are stored in an array.
 2) You can only make 8 wrong guesses after which the game ends and you lose if you didnt guess the correct country.
 3) This program uses the concept of classes and objects.
